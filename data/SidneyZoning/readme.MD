## Sidney zoning file notes

LeoS was sent Sidney_Zoning_LEO.mpk in response to a request.  That's supposed to be an ArcMap file format, but opening it as a ZIP file revealed two File GDBs: v10 and v103.  I (eldang) haven't yet figured out what the difference, if any, between those is, so I saved each as its own shapefile.
