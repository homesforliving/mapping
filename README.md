This repo contains Mapping and Zoning related projects for Homes for Living within the Capital Regional District in B.C., Canada.

The goal is to unify the zoning of municipalities making up the CRD for easier GIS analysis.

Differing municipalities have varying numbers of zoning types; Saanich, for example, has under 20, while the municipality of Victoria has > 100.

A preview of the dataset in its current state is located [here](https://housesforliving.github.io/mapping/).
