# Zoning types and definitions (with examples): 

The zoning types indicated in bold are also classified as "Missing Middle" housing, i.e. middle-density housing (missing because... well, it's often the most uncommon housing type, at least relative to mid/high rises and SFHs)

* Single family / detached house (SFH)
* **Duplex**
* **Townhouse**
* **Low-rise**
* High-rise
* Mixed use low-rise
* Mixed use high-rise
* Commercial
* Industrial
* Recreational / Public (separate for park?)
* Agricultural
* Unclassified
* First Nations
* Golf course

# Instructions:

Each municipality folder (i.e., `/SaanichZoning`) contains a shapefile of that municipality's zoning, and a .csv  (i.e., `zonemap_saanich.csv`) indicating how the various zoning IDs map to our list of classification types.

For example, Saanich is pretty legible and has few zoning types so was easy to classify. We only had to tweak the language: **"Two Family Dwelling"** was classified to our group **Duplex**. Whereas in Esquimalt, the **Duplex** category was assigned to multiple zonings (incl. **"RD-1,Two Family Residential"**, **"RD-2,Two Family Small Lot Residential"**, and **"RD-2X,Two Family Small Lot Residential Modified"**)
